call your name，⑧说了，泪目了

Call your name  - 澤野弘之 (さわの ひろゆき)/R!N/Gemie

Lyrics by：mpi

Composed by：Hiroyuki Sawano

Arranged by：Hiroyuki Sawano

She lost her brother months ago

His picture on the wall

And it reminds me

When she brings me coffee her smile

I wish I could be with her 'til my last day

She said she gave all her love to me

We dreamt a new life

Some place to be at peace

But things changed suddenly

I lost my dreams in this disaster

I'm crying

Missing my lover

I don't have the power

On my side forever

Oh where is my lover

And I got no power

I'm standing alone no way

Calling out your name

I said I gave all my love to you

We dreamt a new house

Some place to be at peace

But things changed suddenly

I lost my dreams in this disaster

We don't know what is wrong tonight

Everybody's got no place to hide

No one's left and there's no one to go on

All I know is my life is gone

I'm crying

Missing my lover

I don't have the power

On my side forever

Oh where is my lover

And I got no power

I'm standing alone no way

Calling out your name
